# MeowBot
MeowBot is a robot shaped like a cute cat that teaches how to teach children in preschools and increase their interest in learning. The use of Meowbot robots in preschool institutions will increase the efficiency of assimilation of information content, increase motivation for learning and physical activity, thanks to the interactive form of classes.

# Full description of the project
1. `Problem.`
     
     The key problem of teaching children in preschool institutions is that modern children have a different type of thinking, different from the thinking of previous generations. This requires teaching staff to 
     have a new approach to organizing the educational process and the use of innovative educational technologies. An insufficient number of staff in preschool institutions creates difficulties in organizing work 
     with children, especially in conditions where great attention is required to each child. To solve this problem, it is necessary to introduce new information technologies that will help make the educational 
     process more effective and interesting for children.
    
2. `Project topic.`
     
     "Education for Children". The robot will be able to teach children in preschool educational institutions, develop their skills and abilities in such areas as mathematical, linguistic, social and cognitive. 
      The functioning of the robot is aimed at assessing the individual needs of each child and providing learning using interactive methods. Creating a unified gaming and educational space, working in 
      collaboration with teachers and parents to create the best conditions for the development of children.
     
3. `Assessment of the current state of the problem being solved.`
     
     1) Early childhood is a critical period for the development of a child's brain, leading to more and more attention being paid to the education and development of children in kindergartens.
     2) Modern educational programs in preschool institutions contain a number of important elements: social, emotional, cognitive and physical development.
     3) Modern kindergartens also include digital technologies such as educational games on tablets, which help develop the child in various aspects.
     4) One of the most important tasks of preschool institutions is the development of children's social and communication skills. Today, kindergartens actively use games and exercises, the purpose of which is 
        to develop communication skills, cooperation and empathy.
     5) Development of children's creative potential. For this purpose, various techniques and technologies are used aimed at developing fantasy, imagination and creative activity.
        
4. `Relevance.`
     
     Robots that teach children in kindergartens are very relevant nowadays. This type of robot can help children expand their knowledge and improve skills such as math, literacy, science concepts, music and 
     more. Moreover, robots can teach children important social skills such as group interaction, working with others, and helping them with individual educational needs. The need for such robots is increasing 
     due to the growing number of children, insufficient number of teachers and the need to individualize learning.
    
5. `Target.` 
      
     Creation of a robot that will help preschool employees instill interest and increase children’s motivation to learn, strive to achieve new results and self-development.

6. `Description of the robot's operation.`
   
   Meowbot is a unique device designed to help children develop. The robot can display tasks on a tablet and ask children for colors, numbers, letters of the alphabet, shapes of figures and reproduce other tasks. 
   After the child answers the question, the robot gives feedback using the Yandex Alice station. If the answer is correct, the robot will praise the child, and if it is incorrect, it will explain and tell the 
   correct answer. In addition, every 15 - 20 minutes the robot performs a physical warm-up. He dances and shows children moves to help them stretch and stay active throughout the day. The robot can play music 
   and perform other entertainment activities. Meowbot has a large knowledge base and can adapt to the individual needs of each child. It helps children learn and develop in an interactive and exciting way. The 
   robot is a reliable assistant for teachers and parents in the education and upbringing of children.

8. `Technical part.`
   
   The main software part is the skill for Yandex Station Alisa, which I wrote in the python programming language. Thanks to this skill, children can practice in a group setting. Alice asks questions in the voice of a cat, and the children answer. For example: what is the hottest time of the year? And if the children answer “summer,” then Alice will praise the children and ask the next question, and if the children answer incorrectly three times, then Alice will say the correct answer and explain why this particular answer is correct. During physical education warm-ups, Alice asks the children the song they want to warm up to. An equally important technical part is the code for interaction between Yandex Alice and the robot. Alice connects to the ESP32 board, which has a built-in wi-fi module, thanks to which the robot and Alice station interact. When the physical education warm-up begins, Alice transmits a signal to the board and the robot begins its movement (shows various physical exercises to children). The robot's movement is written in the Arduino IDE program. MeowBot has a large tablet on which children study individually. There is an educational game on the tablet that I wrote in Android Studio. All elements of the robot are interconnected, so the meowbot works clearly and without errors.

   

# Conclusion

The result of the project was the created Meowbot robot, which is an effective tool for teaching children in kindergartens. It provides children with a unique opportunity to explore various subjects through games and interact with them, conveying information and finding common ground. The use of this approach to learning allows children to become more confident and independent, ready for further learning. The project represents a breakthrough in the field of education, helping children master knowledge and skills in a playful way, which makes learning more fun and interesting. The main benefit of a robot that teaches children in kindergartens is that it can significantly improve the learning and development of children. Benefits of having a robot in kindergartens. Meowbot will help children: better understand the material and learn more effectively, develop critical thinking, creativity and problem-solving skills, show children's interest in science, technology, engineering and mathematics. The robot helps improve social skills and the ability of children to work in a team, and will also be an assistant for educators; it will be possible to optimize time and focus on more complex tasks, while the robot works with children on basic tasks.
